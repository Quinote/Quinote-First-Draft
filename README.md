Missing </div> in frontend.html
After taking a quiz, the text editor UI becomes wonky (I think the quiz in the background is interfering)

Concerning the way dates are parsed, white space matters in most places but not all

List items do not indent properly. (Text editor probably not sending tabbed text in parser-friendly format)

A few of Cameron's many issues:
    Not all toolbar buttons linked.
    Formatting resets on Return/Enter
    User's desire to create a list not handled for them.
