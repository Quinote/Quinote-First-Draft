# Issues/Considerations

• Quit doesn't refresh quiz
• Undefined definitions (when definition is empty)


• Missing </div> in frontend.html
• After taking a quiz, the text editor UI becomes wonky (I think the quiz in the background is interfering)

• Concerning the way dates are parsed, white space matters in most places but not all

• List items do not indent properly (Text editor probably not sending tabbed text in parser-friendly format)
• List items just end if they're too long (may not be an issue, just something to consider)

• A few of Cameron's many issues:
    – Not all toolbar buttons linked
    – Formatting resets on Return/Enter
    – User's desire to create a list not handled for them
